## License

Dr. Russell Campbell owns the collection of $7595$ images of triangulations of the plane on $12$ vertices in this repository. Each image itself is procedurally generated with `C/C++` code and therefore not subject to copyright in Canada / United States, but any subset thereof is protected as a copyrightable collection. For use of any subset beyond one image, contact Dr. Campbell to request permission.

The $123$ unique embeddings of triangulation complements as maximal subsets (2 edges removed) in the torus were the result of a computational search by Dr. Campbell with `C/C++` code adapted from his PhD dissertation. Dr. Allan Bickle led this research on the problem of splitting $K_{12}$ between triangluation of the plane and its complement torus embedding. The drawing of the figures in the PDF document was made possible by `planardraw` code developed by Gunnar Brinkmann. The `planardraw` code will be available from Brinkmann once it is shared by him elsewhere online.
